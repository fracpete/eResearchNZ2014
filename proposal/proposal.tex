The \textbf{New Zealand Data Mining Workshop} is aimed at researchers interested in Data Mining or ones that want to deepen their knowledge on this topic. This full-day workshop is divided into three parts: in the morning, attendants will be able to familiarize themselves with Weka, using the highly successful MOOC series ``Data Mining with Weka'' for self-study (experienced Data Miners will be at hand to answer questions); the afternoon is divided into two sessions, with the first one providing hands-on Data Mining with Weka, using datasets provided by attendants (prior submission required for preparation) which will get discussed and analyzed together; the second session is on building Data Mining applications for these data sets using the ADAMS workflow system, demonstrating how to automate data collection, data cleansing, model building, evaluation and prediction, as well as integration into other systems.

Workshop attendants will be using their own devices throughout the day.
